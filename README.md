Utkarsh Minds Institute Mumbai Internship - Python for Data Science and Statistical Analysis

This repository contains the code and materials for a 2-month virtual internship on Python for data science and statistical analysis completed at Utkarsh Minds Institute Mumbai.

Internship Details:

- Duration: 2 months 
- Platform: Virtual
- Instructor: Mr. Pranav Nerurkar

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Python for Data Science
- Statistical Analysis with Python
- Hypothesis Testing in Python

Projects:

(Hypothesis testing was done on data belonging to the Binary, Nominal, Ordinal, and Scale variables)
- Single Sample Hypothesis Testing: Analyzing data from General Social Studies or Student Statistics to perform hypothesis testing on a single variable.
- Two Sample Hypothesis Testing: Comparing data from General Social Studies or Student Statistics to conduct hypothesis testing on two variables.
- Three or More Variables Hypothesis Testing: Analyzing data from General Social Studies or Student Statistics to perform hypothesis testing on three or more variables.

Datasets and Python Libraries used:

- General Social Studies (GSS2012a.csv)
- Students Statistics (StudentStatistics.csv)
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scipy.stats, and other related.

Learning Outcomes:

- I gained proficiency in using Python for data analysis tasks.
- I have learned how to perform statistical analysis using Python libraries.
- I did understand the concepts of hypothesis testing and applied them to real-world datasets.
